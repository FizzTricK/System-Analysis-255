# System-Analysis-255

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The client was DriverPass who was looking for a system that would be able to prepare drivers for their driving test at the DMV. The system would be up to date with DMV standards and allow users too take lessons and schedule appointments to take driving lessons.
    What did you do particularly well?
    What I did particulary well was finding out what the DriverPass system needed for the client to be satisfied.
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If I had a choice on what to revise it would be my diagrams because they can be a bit rough and could be made to be easier to understand for the client.
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I interpreted the user's needs by fufulling what they are looking for their system to do and what is required too fufill those needs which is why its important to consider the user's needs since their the ones who are using this system.
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    I approach designing software by figuring out the clients needs and figuring out how I can satisfy those needs. Strategies I would use would be interviewing the client to figure out exactly what they are looking for in the system they want.
